# The_Sentient_Chef
This is a project aimed at building a recipe recommender system using machine learning techniques. It includes exploratory data analysis on the data and the deployment of the model using Streamlit.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
The Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed using the Folium map to visualize the cuisine distribution in different countries around the world. The visualization provides insights into the popularity of different cuisines in various parts of the world.

## Recipe Recommender Model
The recipe recommender model is built using NLP and  cosine similarity algorithm. The model recommends similar recipes based on the ingredients used in a given recipe. The model is deployed using Streamlit to provide an interactive interface to the users.

## Deployment
The model is deployed on Streamlit and can be accessed through the following link:https://karthik0899-the-sentient-chef-myfirstsite-vfoadq.streamlit.app/
